# 🚨 Sensor Stream Visualizer & Alert System

A real-time sensor monitoring system that collects structural and environmental data, detects anomalies using machine learning, and triggers alerts for safety monitoring and preventive action.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This system monitors sensor streams such as vibration, strain, and temperature to detect abnormal structural behavior and generate alerts before potential failures occur.

It is designed for **smart infrastructure safety and real-time monitoring applications**.

## 📊 Sensors & Data Captured

The system processes the following parameters:

- Vibration  
- Strai​n  
- Temperature  
- Timestamp  

These readings help detect:

✔ structural stress  
✔ abnormal vibrations  
✔ overheating risks

## 🤖 Anomaly Detection System

The ML module analyzes incoming sensor data and generates:

- **Anomaly Status** → Normal / Abnormal  
- **Anomaly Score** → Severity level  
- **Risk Classification** → Warning / Critical  

This enables intelligent safety monitoring and early risk detection.

## 🚨 Alert & Risk Classification

Sensor readings are categorized into:

- 🟢 **Normal** → Safe condition  
- 🟡 **Warning** → Potential risk detected  
- 🔴 **Critical** → Immediate attention required  

Alerts are automatically triggered when risk thresholds are exceeded.
